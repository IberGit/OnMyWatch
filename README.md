# OnMyWatch
OnMyWatch will be my first App to learn SwiftUI. The mission (the sense of existence) of OnMyWatch will be to try to keep track of the series/movies I'm watching (info, what chapters I've seen, etc.).

It will also have some "foreign" functionality (I will try to give it some objectivity with respect to the App), to test and learn.
